j# Compose for Agents Demos

## Prerequisites

+ **[Docker Desktop] 4.43.0+ or [Docker Engine]** installed.
+ **A laptop or workstation with a GPU** (e.g., a MacBook) for running open models locally. If you
  don't have a GPU, you can alternatively use **[Docker Offload]**.
+ If you're using [Docker Engine] on Linux or [Docker Desktop] on Windows, ensure that the
  [Docker Model Runner requirements] are met (specifically that GPU
  support is enabled) and the necessary drivers are installed.
+ If you're using Docker Engine on Linux, ensure you have [Docker Compose] 2.38.1 or later installed.

## Demos

Each of these demos is self-contained and can be run either locally or using a cloud context. They
are all configured using two steps.

1. change directory to the root of the demo project
2. create a `.mcp.env` file from the `mcp.env.example` file (if it exists, otherwise the demo
   doesn't need any secrets) and supply the required MCP tokens
3. run `docker compose up --build`

### Using OpenAI models

The demos support using OpenAI models instead of running models locally with Docker Model Runner. To use OpenAI:

1. Create a `secret.openai-api-key` file with your OpenAI API key:

    ```plaintext
    sk-...
    ```

2. Start the project with the OpenAI configuration:

    ```sh
    docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.openai.yaml up
    ```
